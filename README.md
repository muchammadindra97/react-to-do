# React To Do List

A simple to do list app built with React JS and basic CSS styling. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Implemented stuff:

- useState
- useRef
- CSS modules
- Window.localStorage

Any feedback will be appreciated!
